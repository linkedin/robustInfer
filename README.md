# robustInfer: Robust and Efficient Statistical Inference
RobustInfer provides implementation of modern robust statistical inference for online experimentation, e.g., regression adjustment, generalized estimating equations, Mannâ€“Whitney U, zero-trimmed U, and Doubly Robust Generalized U. 

RobustInfer contains a Python library that is tailored for small to medium-scale analysis, as well as a Scala (Spark) library that is tailored for large-scale analysis. 

Theoretical details of the algorithms are described in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08128
